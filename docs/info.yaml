  # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).
  And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.
  All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.
